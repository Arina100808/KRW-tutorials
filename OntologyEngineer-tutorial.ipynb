    "1. Look at this [sheet](https://github.com/lisestork/rdf-tutorial/blob/master/data/papers.csv), and design your (simple) ontology (ex: [Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/d/1j7zjq7XAqum2hCROj-tXYuV078Iv-Yjgoo4adIv761s/viewer?pli=1))\n",

    "- For your ontology, reuse existing properties and classes that you can find in: https://lov.linkeddata.es/dataset/lov/\n",
